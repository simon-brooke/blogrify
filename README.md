# blogrify

A set of mainly Clojure hacks designed to migrate a blog off Blogger and into Markdown.

## Discussion

You probably don't want to use this.

It's tooling to move my blog off Blogger and into Markdown format, in my case
in order to serve it with [Smeagol](https://github.com/journeyman-cc/smeagol).
Furthermore, this will almost certainly never by fully productised or
documented. However, if you want to make us of it, you're welcome to do so.
